				## An unusual journey 

				Through technology and the world
				---
				Growing up neurodivergent in Singapore, I was interested in everything. 

				<img data-src="assets/working.jpg">

				---
				### Things I thought I'd do for a living
				* Play the clarinet 
				* Take photos
				* Write
				* Travel
				* Run
				* Build computers
				* Create potato chips flavors
				* Make ice cream

				I ended up doing most of these. 
				---
				I do **nothing** in moderation.

				Asking a fortune teller in Turkey what I was going to do with my life. He told me to be a fortune teller.

				---
				<img data-src="assets/confluence.png" height="450">

  ## Why live like this?

				---

				Most people on the autism spectrum grow up feeling like an alien. "Waiting for aliens to come and take me somewhere I belong," is a common thing we say.

				--- 
				It's hard to have a 'normal career'. Sometimes, a career at all. I knew from the beginning that I would not ever fit in, so I had to make my own path.
				---
				I don't know what 'hard' is. 

				'Not hard' is 'mindnumbingly boring'.
				
				---
				### Start with what

				I identified some common themes. As long as I didn't veer too far off, I figured I would be okay.
				---
				### What

				1. Something with computers
				2. Some amount of travel 
				3. Some kind of 'hard' problem
				4. **Preferably delicious**
				5. Not evil
				6. Something that helps somebody
				

				---
				### How

				"weird", "hyper-focused on specific things with little commonality", "doesn't follow through", "does too little", "does too much"

				---

				The nice thing about being autistic is you can hear what people think about you, because they tell you, but you don't actually know what it means. /s

				--- 
				### Why

				Because I can.
				
				So my career began.

				---
				### 2007 
				
				Bored in college. Started traveling, started travel writing and travel photography. Started web consulting for agencies and startups.

				---

				### 2008

				Graduated. Moved to Dubai. Ate at El Bulli. Photographed and wrote a cookbook for a hotel. 
				---
				### 2009

				Published a travel guidebook. Traveled to Yemen. Traveled overland from Beirut to London. Decided to set down roots in Kuala Lumpur. Got a dog. Started an ice cream business. Started a tech company to support ice cream business.
				---
				### 2010 

				Made games, apps, websites. And ice cream. Lots of consulting.
				---
				### 2012

				Started a [non-profit](https://gyanada.org) in India. 

				--- 
				### 2013

				Started at Uber. Found it broke my 'no evil' rule. Left. Lots of consulting, including in Myanmar and Indonesia.

				---
				### 2014

				Started a fintech startup in Indonesia.

				---
				### 2014-2018

				---
				### 2018

				Moved to San Francisco. Became senior product manager at a hot new database company.
				---
				### 2019

				Became the Director of Product Management for the City and County of San Francisco.

				---
				### 2020

				Built more 'pandemic software' than I imagined possible.

				---
				### 2021
				
				My calling in life? Maybe not (I still want to make potato chips), but it's close.

				---
				### Now: 
				
				I want to do fewer (but still several) things at once, but better.

				--- 

				### Foundational work 

				My pride and joy is the [non-profit](https://gyanada.org) I helped to start in 2012, which is thriving. 
				---

				---
				### Software work

				I've been involved in:

				* Giving millions of dollars away to San Franciscans
				* Making it easier for San Franciscans to get married 
				* Creating a new City outdoor dining program 
				* Imagining a post-pandemic world with better public service

				---
				
				<img data-background-image src="assets/vaccinesearch.png">
				---
				### Tasty work

				Sometimes, I make and sell ice cream at farmer's markets.

				<img data-src="assets/icecreamdog.jpg" height="450">

				---

				A lot of why and how I do what I do, and what drives me, comes from feeling like I don't belong.

				---
				<img data-background-image src="assets/marriage.jpg">
				---
				As an autistic and queer married person in tech, life in Singapore was on 'hard' mode, in spite of the privileges I carry.

				---
				Living and working in San Francisco is far from utopia (I really miss food, and home), but it's the first time I feel I can calm down and just be my whole self.

				---
				### New rules for life 

				1. Do good
				2. Have fun 
				3. See the rest of the world 
				4. Have lots of dogs and cats
